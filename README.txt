The test results (.csv) of each model/method can be found in the Kaggle_csv folder, labeled with their respective method name.

The code (.ipynb) of each model/method can be found in the Model folder:
	Baseline_InceptionResNet includes the baseline model and the models for non-segmentation and segmentation images.
	InceptionResNetwithMetadata includes the fusion model with metadata.

The Jupyter Notebook is coded to get and download the dataset that is already stored in Google Drive. If you like to run the code, please modify any file path if necessary. The content of the notebooks are well-organized, simply follow the order of the notebook cells.
